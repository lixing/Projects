The parser is used to read Decaf source programs and construct a parse tree. If no syntax errors are encountered, it will print the completed parse tree as flat text.

Error handling explorations:

To Generate the parser, it is necessary to add the rules for each of the Decaf grammar features.

If the input is not syntactically valid, the default behavior of the parser is to call yyerror to print a message and halt parsing.

For this parser, it can handles several errors, such as 

1. function declaration formals errors, 
2. variable declaration errors, 
3. generic expression errors, 
4. function call actuals errors
5. if-else statement expression errors. 

All of these errors can be sucessfully decteted and reported by using this parser.

For example, if the text contains "x = 123.4.554;", the parser can detect that it is not satisfied the expression rules "'LValue' '=' 'Constant'", where 'Constant' contains intType, boolType, stringType, doubleType and array.

Consequently, it will report error as following:

*** Error line 2.
  x = 123.4.554;
            ^^^
*** syntax error

The parser will report the error line, point out the error position and indicate that it is the syntax error.
